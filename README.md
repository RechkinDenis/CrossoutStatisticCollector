# CrossoutStatisticCollector
This program collects your fight statistics, and after each fight writes it to the database. Also in the program there is a calculator that calculates based on your fights, all your resources and their number, then it all calculates for certain periods, for a day, week, month and year. And after this data is recorded in a table with your earnings. There is also a general income. There is a sheet with your fights, a filter for fights (victory, defeat, unfinished battle, and bedlam). Also from these fights there is a ratio of victories to defeats. Average experience and points earned.
